### Not finished

A website project with design process on Figma and implementation in javascript.

The website is based on this tutorial:

Update 11/01: 
Implemented the circles on the right to change the main pages (between almond, cashew and pecan)
For now, I have 3 bugs on the main page: 
1. While changing the background colour, the middle part gets dark (is it somehow related to the tutorials code? the colours seem to come from there)
2. If you press the same circle twice, you will get an empty page.
3. the right and left part of the images gets flexed together automatically, without you moving the mouse over it (how it suppose to be)
